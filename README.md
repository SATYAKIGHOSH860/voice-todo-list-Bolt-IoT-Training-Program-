# voice-todo-list-Bolt-IoT-Training-Program-
This project is part of my learning journey during the Bolt IoT Training Program, where I practiced Python programming, Linux usage, automation, and voice-based applications. The app allows users to add, view, and manage tasks using both text and voice commands. All tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence.
