A simple and smart Python-based Voice-Controlled To-Do List App that helps users manage their daily tasks using both voice commands and text input.
This project was built during my Bolt IoT Training Program, where I learned Linux, Python, automation, voice apps, and real-world project building.

The app listens to your voice, converts it into text, and then stores your tasks in a JSON file.
It also reads out responses using a text-to-speech engine, making the whole experience smooth and interactive.

# Built completely in Python, this project shows my understanding of:

1.Python fundamentals

2.Voice recognition

3.Text-to-speech automation

4.JSON data handling

5.Linux terminal workflows

6.Building practical, working applications

This is a beginner-friendly project but very useful for demonstrating skills in automation, Python scripting, and user interaction through voice commands.
